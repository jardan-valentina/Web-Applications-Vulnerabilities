<h1>Testing Web Applications for Vulnerabilities</h1>

For this Challenge assignment, you will continue playing the role of an application security engineer at Replicants. Replicants has created several new web applications and would like you to continue testing them for vulnerabilities. Additionally, your manager would like you to research and test a tool called BeEF in order to understand the impact it could have on the organization if Replicants were targeted with this tool.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

In this assignment, you will test three web application vulnerabilities. For each vulnerability you will be provided with the following:
<ul>
    <li>Steps detailing how to set up and access the application.</li>
    <li>A demonstration explaining how the application is intended to work.</li>
    <li>A task that will test the application for vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>
Your goal is to determine whether each application is vulnerable and, if so, provide mitigations.
